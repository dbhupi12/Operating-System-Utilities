3 first-fit

my_heapinfo()-
I have maintained a linked list of free chunks
and in my_heapinfo() I am iterating over the linked list and calculating the total free size
And by comparing, calculating smallest and largest free chunks too in the same loop
then to calculate current size I subtracted free size from Max size and for number of alloacted
blocks, I have already created a variable intially and mainting count of allocatated blocks by the
the same variable (n_blocks++ in my_alloc() and n_blocks-- in my_free())
and during spliting of chunks I am assigning the first part to the my_alloc() and keep the later part as free.
